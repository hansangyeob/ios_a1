Cong Coffee was born in 2007, with its origins as a small drink shop on Trieu Viet Vuong street in Hanoi – a place famous for the “toad cafes” on the sidewalk since the subsidy period. The Cafe was inspired by that; design and decoration have cultural subsidy. The word Cong (addition) makes us think of “Communism” – the form of the Vietnamese state at that time. Cong Cafe’s strange, interesting, recollective style turns out to be attractive to young people. Young people come to Cong Cafe not only drink coffee but also to experience the green space of the soldiers, with peacock blankets, Rang Dong thermos, wooden cupboards, TV boxes, iron windows … These are the things that used to familiar to us when being young but now no more, making young people nostalgic. Currently, Cong Cafe not only has 14 locations across Hanoi but also has many branches across the country, with the number of young customers always very crowded and busy.",

With the famous mermaid logo in a blue circle, Starbucks is an international brand, ranked 34th in the Top 100 most valuable brands globally by Forbes magazine, above the luxury brands such as Gucci, Audi, Zara …Starbucks entered Vietnam in 2013 after had gone into Hong Kong and Macao markets successfully. According to Ms. Patricia Marques – CEO of Starbucks Vietnam, the Vietnamese market is a growing market with great potential. Vietnamese people have the habit of drinking coffee outside the shops, which are passed down from French and American culture when these two countries occupied Vietnam in the past. Vietnam is also a coffee powerhouse, with the 2nd exporting coffee volume in the world. Therefore, this world’s leading coffee brand decided to penetrate the Vietnamese market. However, in Vietnam, Starbucks faces fierce competition from domestic coffee brands, especially Highlands, which have decentralized customers, and quality relatively close to Starbucks Vietnam. Starbucks did not achieve great success as expected for many reasons: Starbucks does not provide Vietnamese coffee (roasting), Starbucks coffee has high prices compared to the average Vietnamese income; the most favorable places are occupied by Highlands. However, Starbucks is still a strong brand and is gradually gaining the trust of Vietnamese consumers, especially young people, and high-income businessmen, families, as well as a top destination for foreign tourists in major cities.",
