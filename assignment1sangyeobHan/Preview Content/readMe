When I try to pull my code from the git, I don’t know why but json file is having an error.
You won’t be pulling my code from the git(cannot read json file from the git) so I don’t worry a lot but for just in case, I’m putting the data in this file which is same with “ShopData.json”.
 If you have problem running my code, you can copy and paste the data on here to new ShopData.json.
Thank you!
